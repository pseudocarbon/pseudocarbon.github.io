<h2>Designing and building a Synchronous 3-bit Binary Down Counter</h2>
<p>Building a 3-BBDC can be achieved using increasingly useful ICs such as D Flip-Flops (SN7474J).</p>

<p>The requirements of the desired functionality dictate the design of the circuit. Our 3-bit down counter displays the set of numbers 0-7 in descending order (ie counting down 7, 6, 5, ..).</p>
<p>Various trick components including D Flip-Flops, a BCD to 7-Segment display, as well as logic gates AND, OR and XOR make up the design for the circuit.</p>

<p><i>State Transition Table and Equations</i></p>
<p>Filling a transition table with the desired outputs gives an overall view of the circuit. (table 1)
