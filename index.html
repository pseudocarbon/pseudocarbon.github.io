<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This site shall be a place for me to upload projects related to web development. I hope to make some progress in html and javascript, and maybe create some cool stuff.</p>
<p>For now, though, I hope you are satisfied with a plain html page.</p>
<p>The journey into the mountains of web development starts in the foothills, where one may prepare for the adventures that lie ahead.</p>
